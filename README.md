# Firstshotatthiswholething

This repository and corresponding website are my first attempt at using github along with R to create anything of this type.
I do not really know what else to put here so I am going to use it to keep some notes about how this has gone. I have been having some user error problems in making github and R communicate but I think I have gotten those resolved. Pulling images from my computer into R has not been working with the same commands that I have used in the past. I am not sure if that is something subtle that I have changed in the code or if R servers online could have a different path to files than local R downloaded on my computer. Finally the Github side of things remains confusing and I do not feel comfortable with that interface yet.
