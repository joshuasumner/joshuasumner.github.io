Hello, my name is Josh Sumner. 
I am a senior exercise science major out of Appalachian State University in North Carolina with a concentration in strength and conditioning and a minor in statistics. I will graduate in 2019 and I am currently pursuing graduate school options.
My interests include strength and conditioning, strength sports, health care/research, and data analysis.
My personal life is personal and generally notwithstanding but if you have questions about Fin, I will answer in as timely and thorough of a manner as I possibly can.
I can be reached at "sumnerjq@appstate.edu"
