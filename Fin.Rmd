##Dogs that look sort of like Fin
This is a dog that looks a lot like Fin. I was going to put pictures of Fin himself on here, but that has proven complicated and has already caused a few problems.

This dog looks a whole lot like Fin. This guy is a german shepherd and rhodesian ridgeback mix, we know Fin is half german shepherd but he is a rescue so we are not totally sure of what all he is.

One more, this dog looks like Fin, but they are clearly not that similar since Fin would be very scared of the cat and would definitely not risk his nose sniffing one long enough to get a picture.

##Dogs that do not look like Fin.
###The cute ones
This is a dog that does not look like Fin really at all. He's still great though.

Another great dog who just happens to not look like Fin whatsoever.

###The not-so-cute ones

Still looks nothing like Fin, but this dog's hair bears a passing resemblance to Trump. There is such amazing variety in nature. Isn't it grand?

##Further inquiries about Fin
By now I'm sure you have a pretty complete picture of what Fin looks like. You still can't possibly understand what a fantastic dog he is but I guess that'll just have to be the case for now.

If you are looking for a dog like Fin then you might be out of luck since he is already taken. You might have some luck looking at the [humane society](https://www.humanesociety.org) but Fin is pretty cool so it is hard to guarantee.

Once again, email inquiries about Fin will be treated as a priority and pictures of Fin himself will be available.
